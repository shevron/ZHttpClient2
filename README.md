Zend Framework 2.0 Alternative HTTP Client Module
-------------------------------------------------

This module provides an alternative HTTP client for Zend
Framework 2.x (and other) projects.

It is based on the original ZF2 HTTP client stack and contains
changes originally intended to go into ZF2 but never made it to
the release date.

Note that the API for this HTTP client is similar, but not
compatible, with the current HTTP client API in ZF2.
