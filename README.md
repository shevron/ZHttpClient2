Zend Framework 2.0 Alternative HTTP Client Module
-------------------------------------------------

This module provides an alternative HTTP client for Zend 
Framework 2.0 (and other) projects. 

It is based on the original ZF2 HTTP client stack and contains
changes originally intended to go into ZF2 but never made it to
the realse date. In the future (e.g. ZF 2.1) it may be merged 
into ZF2. 

Note that the API for this HTTP client is similar, but not 
compatible, with the current HTTP client API in ZF2.
